# JuiceExamples
Example notebooks and code to get familiar with the Juice library

Note that current notebook examples are for version `0.3`. Many of the examples won't work as is from `v0.4`. You do not need to change anything as this version requirement is already applied in the `Project.toml`. For more recent examples please refer to the documentation website for the corresponding library (`LogicCircuits.jl` or `ProbabilisticCircuits.jl`).
